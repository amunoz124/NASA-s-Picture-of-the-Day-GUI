Title: NASA's Picture of the Day

Creators:
Munoz, Andy

What is it?

It's a GUI we created using one of NASA's API's to show an image or video that NASA posts everyday on one of their websites. Basically
everyday there will be a new image or video for you to look at, as well as the explanation behind the image or video. A title corresponding
to that image will always be displayed.

Requirements:

Python 3
Download requests (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30362600/how-to-install-requests-module-in-python-3-4-instead-of-2-7) & 
pillow (https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.1.x/installation.html) onto Python using pip install.
An internet connection.

Things you need to know:

1) When you run the GUI and if the explanation looks like it's cut off, it isn't. You will need to use your mousepad, using two fingers 
to scroll like you would on a website.
2)When there is a video, there will be a button displayed that you will need to click to redirect you to that video. It will open the
website on your web browser.
3)Depending on your internet speed, it might take a while to run the GUI.
4)After running the GUI, the image displayed will be downloaded onto the folder of the .py file and README text. You may delete it if
you wish, however, the image will overwrite itself if you run the GUI the next day because a new image will be displayed. None of this 
applies if the button to redirect you to a video is shown.
