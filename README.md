## What to Expect
Here are some important things to know as you embark on your cosmic journey:

1. If the explanation appears cut off, don't worryâ€”it's not. You can scroll, just like you would on a website, to access the full content.

2. When a video is featured, a convenient button will be presented. Clicking it will seamlessly redirect you to the captivating video on your web browser, ensuring an immersive experience.

3. Please be patient with the loading times, as they may vary depending on your internet speed. The universe's wonders are worth the wait.

4. After running the GUI, the displayed image will be automatically downloaded into the folder containing the .py file and README text. If you prefer, you can delete it, but be aware that running the GUI again the next day will replace the image with a new one. However, this doesn't apply when the GUI offers the option to redirect you to an enthralling video experience.
